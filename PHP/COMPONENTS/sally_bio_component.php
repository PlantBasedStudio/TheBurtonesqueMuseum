                <p>Sally is a rag doll created by Dr. Finklestein, an eccentric
                    inventor from Halloween Town. She has been assembled from
                    various parts and has visible seams all over her body.
                    Despite her fragile appearance, Sally is endowed with great
                    intelligence, sensitivity and a will of her own.</p>

                <p>Sally is a symbol of freedom and emancipation. She aspires to
                    an independent life and true love. Her character embodies
                    inner strength and perseverance in the face of adversity.</p>

                <p>Sally proves to be a valuable ally for Jack when she
                    discovers his plans to take over Christmas.</p>
