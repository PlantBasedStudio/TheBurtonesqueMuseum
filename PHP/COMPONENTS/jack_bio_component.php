                <p>Jack is Halloween Town's king of pumpkins and master of
                    fright.</p>

                <p>He's recognizable by his thin, skeletal figure, pumpkin skull
                    and black-and-white costume. Although he's the master of
                    fright, Jack Skellington feels dissatisfied and bored with
                    his monotonous, repetitive life in Halloween Town.</p>

                <p>Jack Skellington is a complex and fascinating character, both
                    dark and endearing. His story captivates audiences by
                    exploring themes of identity, self-discovery and the search
                    for one's true passion.</p>
