                <p>Zero is a small ghost dog with a sphere-shaped body and a
                    luminous pumpkin nose. Despite his transparent appearance,
                    he has a warm and devoted personality. Zero is faithfully
                    attached to Jack and accompanies him wherever he goes.</p>

                <p>As well as being a loyal companion, Zero is also useful to
                    the film's plot. His luminous nose serves as a luminous
                    guide for Jack in the dark, and he is often used as a kind
                    of improvised flashlight. His dim but constant glow is both
                    practical and symbolic in the story.</p>

                <p>Zero embodies loyalty, friendship and innocence. His role in
                    "The Curious Christmas of Mr. Jack" brings emotional balance
                    and adds a touch of tenderness to the overall dark and
                    strange story.</p>
